## **Project Overview**

This project is a Frontend Mentor challange site, that uses link shortener API.
I used Tailwind CSS framework and created custom variables for this page.
This page was build with mobile first approach and it is fully responsive.
Link shortener form requieres a valid URL, otherways it responds with an error.
Shortening valid url triggers small loading screen that dissapears after sucessfully fetching
the API response. Response data is then appended to DOM.
